# Striker-Stats

An Overwolf application that seeks to help beginners learn awakening choices in the game, Omega Strikers. This app uses Terreract.js to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on command when a player wants to analyze the available awakenings, and be recommended a choice based on their previous selections and awakenings that have already left the availability pool.
